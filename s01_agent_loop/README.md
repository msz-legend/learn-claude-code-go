> One loop and one shell tool are enough to turn a chat model into an agent.

## The Problem

The model can propose a shell command but stops after emitting it. Without a harness, a human has to run every command and paste the result back.

## How It Works

1. Send the conversation and the tool specs to the model.
2. Append the assistant blocks; if there is no tool_use block, return the text.
3. Run every tool_use, append one tool_result per call, and loop.

## Code Map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `s01_agent_loop/main.go` | Chapter entry point: wires this mechanism into one loop. |
| `internal/harness/loop.go`, `internal/harness/cli.go`, `internal/harness/workspace.go` | Shared implementation used by every chapter. |

## Run

```bash
go run ./s01_agent_loop
```

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in one provider before the first run. --help works without credentials.

## Try This

- Ask it to list the workspace and then read the largest file.
- Ask a question that needs no tool and confirm the loop exits after one turn.
