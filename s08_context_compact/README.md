## The Problem

Conversations outgrow the window. Dropping old messages loses decisions; keeping everything fails the request. The harness needs a middle path.

## How It Works

1. Archive oversized tool results and leave a path plus a preview.
2. Truncate old tool output before touching the conversation shape.
3. Summarize older turns, keep recent messages, and repeat truncation if needed.

## Code Map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `s08_context_compact/main.go` | Chapter entry point: wires this mechanism into one loop. |
| `internal/harness/context.go`, `internal/harness/compactor.go` | Shared implementation used by every chapter. |
| `.compact/` | State written by this chapter. |

## Run

```bash
go run ./s08_context_compact
```

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in one provider before the first run. --help works without credentials.

## Try This

- Set COMPACT_SUMMARIZE_AT_TOKENS=1500 and COMPACT_KEEP_MESSAGES=2.
- Run /context before and after a long file read.
