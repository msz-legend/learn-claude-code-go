# learn-claude-code (Go)

[English](README.md) · [中文](README.zh.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md)

A 17-chapter port of [learn-claude-code](https://github.com/shareAI-lab/learn-claude-code) to Go. The course builds one coding agent from a bare loop to permissions, hooks, memory, tasks, teams, workflows, and a goal evaluator.

The port uses the **standard library only**: `net/http` for transport, `encoding/json` for the wire format, and the `os/exec` package for tools and MCP servers. There is no SDK and no module dependency.

> This repository is a sibling of the original Python course, not a replacement. Read a chapter's concept here, then compare it with the Python source when you want the shortest version.

## Requirements

- Go 1.22 or newer (`go version`)
- PowerShell 7, Windows PowerShell 5.1, or a POSIX shell
- One model provider: an Anthropic API key, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

## Quick start

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# edit .env: set LLM_PROTOCOL and one API key

go test ./...
go run ./s01_agent_loop
```

To build every chapter at once:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
.\bin\s01_agent_loop.exe
```

On macOS or Linux, the same steps without PowerShell:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
go build ./...
go run ./s01_agent_loop
```

Every chapter accepts `--help` and prints its tools and tuning knobs without contacting a model.

## Providers

`LLM_PROTOCOL` selects the wire format. If it is unset, the harness infers the protocol from whichever key is present.

| Protocol | Required | Typical base URL | Model variable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `https://api.anthropic.com` | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` |
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | `OPENAI_MODEL` |

`MODEL_ID` overrides both model variables. OpenAI-compatible examples:

| Provider | `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `MODEL_ID` |
|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` | `deepseek-chat` |
| GLM | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` | `glm-4.6` |
| Qwen | `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` | `qwen-plus` |
| Ollama | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | `llama3.2` |

  json.go                small helpers over encoding/json
  tools.go               bash, read_file, write_file, edit_file, glob
  permission.go          deny / ask / allow policy
  hooks.go               four hook points
  compactor.go           archive, truncate, summarize
  tasks.go               file-backed task graph
  team.go                mailboxes and teammates
  workflow.go            journaled step runner
  goal.go                independent stop-boundary evaluator

s01_agent_loop/          each chapter has a main package
s02_tool_use/
...
s17_goal_loop/
skills/                  SKILL.md examples for s07 and s15
```

State created at runtime lives under `.memory/`, `.tasks/`, `.cron/`, `.compact/`, `.team/`, and `.workflows/`. These directories are ignored by git.

## Design notes

- **One loop.** Every chapter reaches the same `AgentLoop.Run`. A chapter entry point only chooses tools and composes the ports.
- **Provider-neutral messages.** `Msg` and `Block` model text, tool use, and tool results; each client translates to its own JSON shape.
- **Failures are messages.** Blocked tools and unknown tools return a `tool_result` with an error flag, so the model can recover instead of crashing the loop.
- **Durable state is plain files.** No database, no hidden daemon. You can inspect, delete, or diff everything the harness remembers.
- **Teaching code stays small.** Error handling is present where it prevents silent corruption, not as production hardening.

## Port notes

The Python course gives each chapter a standalone script. This port keeps chapter entry points thin and shares one harness, so the same mechanism is not copied 17 times. When a chapter needs a smaller tool surface, it builds a separate registry.

Interfaces and small structs keep the code close to the Python original where that helps the lesson. Concurrency is introduced only where the chapter is about concurrency: background tasks, teams, and the scheduler.

On a memory-constrained Windows host, parallel linking can fail with `failed to create new OS thread`. Set `GOFLAGS=-p=1` before `go build`, `go test`, or `go vet`.
