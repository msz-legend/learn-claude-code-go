## The Problem

Free-form agents choose their next step at runtime, which makes a long flow hard to resume and hard to audit. Some work has a known shape.

## How It Works

1. Define workflows as ordered steps with explicit phases.
2. Journal every agent call and step result under .workflows/<run>/.
3. Resume by replaying the journal and skipping completed steps.

## Code Map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `s16_workflow_runtime/main.go` | Chapter entry point: wires this mechanism into one loop. |
| `internal/harness/workflow.go`, `internal/harness/loop.go` | Shared implementation used by every chapter. |
| `.workflows/` | State written by this chapter. |

## Run

```bash
go run ./s16_workflow_runtime
```

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in one provider before the first run. --help works without credentials.

## Try This

- Run /run review, then rerun with the same run id.
- Run two reviews in parallel and compare the journal.
