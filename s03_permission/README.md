> Check the action before it runs, and keep the decision visible to the model.

## The Problem

A tool table with no gate will run destructive commands without hesitation. Warnings after execution are too late; the policy has to sit before the call.

## How It Works

1. Hard-deny patterns that should never run.
2. Match softer rules and mark them ask, so a human can decide.
3. Return a blocked tool_result instead of throwing, so the model can recover.

## Code Map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `s03_permission/main.go` | Chapter entry point: wires this mechanism into one loop. |
| `internal/harness/permission.go`, `internal/harness/loop.go` | Shared implementation used by every chapter. |

## Run

```bash
go run ./s03_permission
```

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in one provider before the first run. --help works without credentials.

## Try This

- Run /rules, then ask it to delete a scratch directory.
- Set PERMISSION_MODE=allow and compare the behavior.
