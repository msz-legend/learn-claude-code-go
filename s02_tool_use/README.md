> A dispatch table turns the model's intentions into a small, auditable set of actions.

---

## The Problem

One shell can do anything, but every action is opaque and hard to check. A tool table makes the available actions explicit and keeps file paths inside the workspace.

## How It Works

1. Give each tool a name, a description, and a JSON schema.
2. Dispatch strictly by name; never eval a model-provided string.
3. Resolve every path against the workspace root and reject escapes.

## Code Map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `s02_tool_use/main.go` | Chapter entry point: wires this mechanism into one loop. |
| `internal/harness/tools.go`, `internal/harness/tool.go`, `internal/harness/workspace.go` | Shared implementation used by every chapter. |

## Run

```bash
go run ./s02_tool_use
```

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in one provider before the first run. --help works without credentials.

## Try This

- Run /tools and compare the list with the schemas the model sees.
- Ask it to read ../README.md and observe the refusal.

## Next

Continue to [s03: Permission System](../s03_permission/README.md).
