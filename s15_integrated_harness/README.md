> One loop, every port: the mechanisms are only interesting together.

## The Problem

Each mechanism is small on its own. The real harness question is how permissions, plans, memory, tasks, notifications, and compaction share one turn.

## How It Works

1. Wire every tool into one registry and keep child tools smaller.
2. Compose permission, hooks, compaction, and notifications around one loop.
3. Expose /status so the operator can see what the harness holds.

## Code Map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `s15_integrated_harness/main.go` | Chapter entry point: wires this mechanism into one loop. |
| `internal/harness/loop.go`, `internal/harness/todo.go`, `internal/harness/skills.go`, `internal/harness/memory.go`, `internal/harness/tasks.go`, `internal/harness/background.go`, `internal/harness/cron.go`, `internal/harness/context.go`, `internal/harness/agents.go` | Shared implementation used by every chapter. |
| `.tasks/, .memory/, .cron/, .compact/` | State written by this chapter. |

## Run

```bash
go run ./s15_integrated_harness
```

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in one provider before the first run. --help works without credentials.

## Try This

- Ask for a multi-step task and inspect /status and /tasks.
- Run a slow command, ask a question, and let the notification arrive.
